'''
Project Euler.

Problem 53.

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.

In general,
nCr = n!/r!(n?r)! ,where r ? n, n! = nx(n?1)x...x3x2x1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr, for 1 ? n ? 100, are greater than one-million?
